                    <a>My name is Nathan Norman. I love to create, learn, and be challenged. I have taught myself how to tool and shape leather into armor, My dad taught me how to work on cars, how to build things out of wood and steel. 
                        I have also taught myself many other things such as sewing, foam crafting, when I'm not learning or working on a project, I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my son and wife.
